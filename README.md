# Hi there.

My name is Bartłomiej Dach. I read and write code—in that order—for a living, and as a hobby.

Most of my professional experience is on the backend side, working with web applications. My primary area of expertise is .NET and C\#. In my own time, I have dabbled in other things—some frontend web work, some desktop app development, some mobile app development, some data churning, some basic UI design work.

Most of my activity on GitHub is currently focused around [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) and related projects, where I participate in issue triage, respond to discussions, and review pull requests. Every now and again I will even write code.

Sometimes, when I am able to muster words that could potentially be useful or interesting to other people and have time to put them down in writing, I put them on my [blog](https://bdach.github.io/). This does not happen very often.
